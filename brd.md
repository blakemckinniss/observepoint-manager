For the crawl phase of this project, laying out here our typical validation process for Basecamp/Azure projects with Digital Properties: 

 

Digital Properties team member reaches out to Brooke or Mike, asking to provide tracking requirements for digital assets going live. This notification is received via Basecamp/Azure automated email. 

Brooke or Mike looks at digital assets and responds within the Basecamp/Azure ticket with tracking details: 

 

Ex: Hi Rachel and Jason - Please see our tracking recommendations below:

Brooke or Mike inputs campaign details and tracking requirements into CTA dictionary:  https://dardencorp-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/bxt180301_darden_com/EZNcVzigMYJBv_eOYxux8F4Bat0VloWH-xjg5l-i7wYAeg?e=puClPO  

Developer builds page or digital asset, including tracking values 

Digital Properties or Developers respond in Basecamp/Azure ticket, asking Brooke or Mike to validate the digital analytics on the newly built page or asset. 

Brooke or Mike checks that a page view fires with the appropriate eVar 100 (Page Name). We also manually click on each CTA for both Desktop and Mobile Web Beta links to ensure Event 75 (General Click Event) fires only once every time and that there is a unique eVar 70 (Click Event Item). If applicable, we will also verify that videos have a distinct name and that each form has a unique name. 

After manually validating both Desktop and Mobile Web Beta links with the updated assets and tracking, we respond in the Basecamp/Azure ticket stating that the page has been validated. If there is anything wrong or broken, we provide feedback. If everything is good and uniquely tracked, we respond saying it’s good to go. 

A bonus is validating the digital asset in Prod after receiving the digital properties launch email.

CTA Tracking requirements: 

Hero CTA: reservation-hero-cta 
Top CTA: reservation-top-cta 
Bottom CTA: reservation-bottom-cta 

 

Outcome: 

Ensure that there is a Page View with a corresponding eVar 100 and that each CTA fires Event 75 and has the right, distinct eVar 70 values. Additionally, have an automated way to notify Mike or me if it has been validated and whether the tracking is correct or incorrect.
